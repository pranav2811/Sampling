# Dataset Balancing and Sampling Techniques for Machine Learning Models

## Overview

This Python notebook demonstrates how to balance an imbalanced dataset and apply various sampling techniques on five different machine learning models. The notebook includes the following steps:

1. Loading the dataset
2. Balancing the dataset
3. Creating five different samples
4. Applying five different sampling techniques
5. Training five different machine learning models
6. Evaluating the models

## Dependencies

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter scikit-learn imbalanced-learn
 ```

 ## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Open the Dataset_Balancing_and_Sampling.ipynb notebook.

Follow the instructions and run each cell sequentially.

## Files Included

1. Dataset_Balancing_and_Sampling.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for balancing the dataset and applying sampling techniques on machine learning models.
2. README.md: This file providing an overview of the notebook and instructions for usage.
