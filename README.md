# Dataset Balancing and Sampling Techniques for Machine Learning Models

## Overview

This Python notebook demonstrates how to balance an imbalanced dataset and apply various sampling techniques on five different machine learning models. The notebook includes the following steps:

1. Loading the dataset
2. Balancing the dataset
3. Creating five different samples
4. Applying five different sampling techniques
5. Training five different machine learning models
6. Evaluating the models

The notebook uses the following sampling techniques:

1. Simple Sampling
2. Stratified Sampling
3. Cluster Sampling
4. Systematic Sample
5. Convenience Sampling

The notebook uses the following machine learning models:
1. Decision Tree
2. KNN
3. SVC
4. Logistic Regression
5. Random Tree
