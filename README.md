# Dataset Balancing and Sampling Techniques for Machine Learning Models

## Overview

This Python notebook demonstrates how to balance an imbalanced dataset and apply various sampling techniques on five different machine learning models. The notebook includes the following steps:

1. Loading the dataset
2. Balancing the dataset
3. Creating five different samples
4. Applying five different sampling techniques
5. Training five different machine learning models
6. Evaluating the models
